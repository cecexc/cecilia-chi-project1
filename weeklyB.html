    <h1>weekly b 1/29</h1>

    <p>This week we learned the Div tag.
        I didn't knew there were different types.
    </p>


    <div class="sticky">This div tag is sticky and is basically the default setting.</div>
    
    <p>Also through CSS, I learned how to do some styling things like adding borders and color
        to those borders. 
    </p>
    <div class="relative"> This is the relative class,
        and this block is relative to the content around it.</div>
        <p>The next class is absolute.</p>
        <div class="absolute"> This block is pinned on this point.
            I think this block is cool. I might use it often for our poem exercise.
        </div>

        <p class="after"> We were assigned two exercises too. 
            The first one is to use links to make a narrative. We can only use html, no css styling.
            I have an idea to make the narrative about a day of my life as a studio art major.
            My problem is keeping track of the links. I assume that I'll make at least 20 html files.
            And use the a tag <b>a lot</b>. 
            I also want to try adding gifs since I know how to make one in photoshop.
        </p>
    
        <p class="after2">
            Our second exercise is to take a poem and make 5 variations of it.
            We can experiment styling with css.
            I didn't want to bother looking for a poem to play around with.
            So, I used my own writing from my artist statements.
            I also learned about the pre tag.
        </p>

        <pre class="a3"> You can add text
                 add space here and there
                        add line breaks without adding a tag

            and the text will come out formatted like it is in code.
            This will be helpful. 
        </pre>
    <p class="a4">The discussion was interesting.
        It made me think more about UX design and making the design more accessible.
        From what I remembered from the few Graphic design classes I took before switching to Studio Arts,
        experimenting with font types and color combos yet maintaining readability.
        I didn't think that certain colors were used for accessibility.
