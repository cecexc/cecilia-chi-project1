    <p>It was fun to re-learn how to code in HTML.
     The last time I used HTML was during my first semester as a first-year student at UMASS - Lowell.
     It was for my digital foundations class; I don’t remember much class material since it was over five years ago.
     We had one assignment to write about a childhood memory in HTML.
     I think we had to use Adobe Dreamweaver.
     For some reason, I wrote about the time my dad and I were testing out cars at a dealership store, and I cried in the back car seat after hitting my head due to my dad’s terrible driving.
     I still have the file, but I don’t recommend looking at it.
     I made unreadable styling choices.</p>
    <span></span>
    <p>I did learn new things too.
    Like just now, I can add space between two paragraphs.
    I know how to add <b>headers</b></p>
    <h1>Like this</h1>
    <p>I can headers <b>smaller</b> too</p>
    <h2>It's getting smaller</h2>
    <h3>And smaller</h3>
    <h6>And smallest</h6>
    <span></span>
    <p>Here's a <b>list</b> of classes I'm currently taking</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Internet Art</li>
        <li>Painting Now</li>
        <li>Life Drawing (2)</li>
        <li>Senior Exhibition</li>
    </ul>
    <span></span>
    <p>From the readings for the World Wide Web discussion, I found the WWW timeline very interesting.
        It was cool to see the Internet's firsts and how fast it developed.
        Even though I have used Youtube and Twitter for years, I didn't knew the first video and tweet uploaded.

    <p>Lastly, Lunar New Year is coming up. 2023 is the year of the rabbit. Enjoy this picture of a rabbit.</p>
