    <pre style="font-size: 16pt;">
    <del><b>Xinyi</b></del> liked hiding behind curtains.
        She liked drawing on them with her markers.
            Crying that no one respected her name, I cleaned the curtains.
                I saw that girl less and less.
        
                    At age 16, I remember grandma crying because I didnâ€™t respond to <del><b>Xinyi</b></del>.
        
                        Can you <i>still</i> see her?
                            Can you <i>still</i> see her drawings?
