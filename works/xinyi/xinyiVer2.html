Xinyi liked hiding behind curtains.
She liked drawing on them with her markers.
Crying that no one respected her name, I cleaned the curtains.
I saw that girl less and less.

At age 16, I remember grandma crying because I didnâ€™t respond to Xinyi.

Can you still see her?
Can you still see her drawings?
