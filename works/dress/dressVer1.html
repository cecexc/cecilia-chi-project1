        When I was 7, I was excited to wear a tulle dress my dad bought for the first time. 
            I was curious about how the light bounced between the layers when I shifted my legs. 
                                My dad’s bible teacher’s wife told me to stop with my <span style="font-size: large;"><i>seductive behavior.</i></span>
        
            When I was 9, I tried wearing a dress again after two years. 
                I liked the floral pattern, and it made me feel really pretty. 
                My bible teacher pulled me aside to scold me as the elders found my exposed knees <span style="font-size: large;"><i>distracting.</i></span>
        
        When I was 10, my body was standing, doing nothing.
                <del>My body covered itself out of shame.</del>
                <del>My body went mute out of fear.</del>
                <del>My body lied that</del> he was nice to me out of kindness.
        How dare he walk away after leaving my body rugged like that?
        
                            <span style="font-size: larger;"><b>When I was 15, I left the cult.</b></span>
        <del>The echoes of the other girls and boys shamed by the elders for reporting were too loud.</del>
        
                    Who the <strong style="font-size: large;"><i>hell</i></strong> made this system?
                    <i>The elders? The patriarchy? Jehovah?</i>
                <b style="font-size: 20pt; color: red;">I’ll crush them all and take back what was mine.</b>
