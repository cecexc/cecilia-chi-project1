        In my freshman year, we started the color unit in my Art Concepts I class (equivalent to Art 2300 Two-Dimensional Studies in OSU). 
        The assignment was to find a picture and use the assigned color palettes. 
        <br><br>I picked a photo of me when I was 4-5 years old and a split complementary palette (yellow, red-violet, blue-violet). 
        <br><br>Since my skin was the lightest in the picture, it was a natural choice to color it with the lightest color, yellow. 
        <br><br>My white friend approached me, asking if it was offensive to color myself yellow. 
        <br><br>At the time, she complained that we, POC were too sensitive to putting race into every conversation. 
        <br><br>However, wasn’t it more offensive that she brought up the yellow comment? 
        Wasn’t she the one who brought race into the discussion?
        I was purely making a design choice. 
        <br><br>Since then, I have drawn myself yellow out of spite.
        I learned to like yellow.
        I learned how empowering yellow could be.
        However, it’s only empowering if I’m drawing myself yellow.
        No one else can color me yellow.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
        Yellow is warm.
        <br><br>Yellow is joyful.
        <br><br>Yellow is tender.
        <br><br>Yellow is healing.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
        Don’t you dare apply the negative connotations to me.
        <br><br>Don’t you dare define Chinese for me.
