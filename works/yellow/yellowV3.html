<p>In my freshman year, we started the color unit in my Art Concepts I class (equivalent to Art 2300 Two-Dimensional Studies in OSU).</p> 
<p>The assignment was to find a picture and use the assigned color palettes. I picked a photo of me when I was 4-5 years old and a split complementary palette (yellow, red-violet, blue-violet).</p>
<p>Since my skin was the lightest in the picture, it was a natural choice to color it with the lightest color, yellow. My white friend approached me, asking if it was offensive to color myself yellow.</p>
<p>At the time, she complained that we, POC were too sensitive to putting race into every conversation.</p>
<p>However, wasn’t it more offensive that she brought up the yellow comment?</p>
<p>Wasn’t she the one who brought race into the discussion?</p>
<p>I was purely making a design choice. Since then, I have drawn myself yellow out of spite.</p>
<p>I learned to like yellow.</p>
<p>I learned how empowering yellow could be.</p>
<p>However, it’s only empowering if I’m drawing myself yellow.</p>
<p>No one else can color me yellow.</p>
<br> 
<p>Yellow is warm.</p>
<p>Yellow is joyful.</p>
<p>Yellow is tender.</p>
<p>Yellow is healing.</p>
<br> 
<p>Don’t you dare apply the negative connotations to me.</p>
<p>Don’t you dare define Chinese for me.</p>
