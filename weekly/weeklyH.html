    <h1>weekly h 4/9</h1>
    <p>
    We started the week presenting what we did for the exercise.
    <br>Everyone made cool drawings using custom functions and parameters that they can adjust.
    <br>The animations were cool, and I wish I gave myself more time to add some motion.
    <br>I like what I made and think it's pretty. But I wish that I could've added more.
    <br>Also, in java, we learned about arrays and adding interactivity. Maybe, I can add mouse interactions on my flowers
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
    The final was introduced, and it's basically an opportunity to expand on a previous exercise.
    <br> First, I want to go back into the website and add motion to the drawings on the home page.
    <br> Also, change my bio into something less serious, but maybe it's fine as is.
    <br>I think I want to go back to the 5 variations exercise.
    <br>I made a few writings on the site that have only one variation.
    <br> I would like to experiment on what I could do with styling with all the skills I have learned.
    <br>For each writing I currently have on site, I think I'll make at least 3 variations.
    <br> Also, give myself some styling prompts like "only use HTML" or "include an element made in Java."

    To finish the week, my group presented the meme culture discussion.
    <br> Honestly, I was surprised with the provided readings being intrenched in politics and communities that I'm not a part of like the alt-right MAGA groups.
    <br>I was expecting to be more on-topic with the current state of the internet like TikTok, their potential ban(?), or AI art.
    <br>Still, it was interesting to look into a bit of the mind of someone who's chronically online with opposite political views.
    <br>I wasn't really aware of the conspiracies before reading the articles since I avoided these communities like the black plague.
    <br>Since reading the articles and Elon's taking over on Twitter, I now know what conspiracy posts look like and fear how quick they spread.
    <br> I remember seeing a tweet about major weather warnings hitting the Midwest and Southern regions this spring.
    <br> And one of the replies was an alt-righter saying "so weird this doesn't happen in the east coast" with a suspcious emoji.
    <br> I thought I was going crazy.
    <br>On a less serious note, a meme I would like back is the nyan cat. I've been in the Vocaloid community since 2010 and never realized the singer was Hatsune Miku.
