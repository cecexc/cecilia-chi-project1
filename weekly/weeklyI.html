    <h1>weekly i 4/18</h1>
    <p>
    Not much has happened this past week.<br>
    Most of class was studio time working on the final project.<br>
    I decided to add more styling variations on the other writings already on the website.<br>
    I'm going to try to add jquery and java interactions to the variations.<br>
    I'm mostly worried about time because I have my thesis show install soon and don't have everything done yet.<br>
    There's also the BFA open house that I need to set up.<br>
    As long as I stay positive and work on a steady pace, I should be done by the 24th.

    Within studio time, we had workshops, but I don't think I'll be adding them to my final.<br>
    The last discussion was about imagined communities.<br>
    I thought it was interesting since I'm apart of these communities of specific niches.<br>
    It made me think about how these communities were made and the efforts to keep these communities alive.<br>
    I also became aware of how I act differently online and irl. It's relieving that other people do this.<br>
    </p>
    <p>
    Anyways, I need to go finish my thesis and finals.<br>
    See ya
