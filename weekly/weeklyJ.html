    <h1>weekly j 4/23</h1>
    <p>
    This week is our last full week of the semester. The whole week was studio time to work on the final project.
    <br>Also, on this week was installation of my senior thesis in Urban Art Space.
    <br>I finished install on Fri, and I'm very happy on how I transformed the space.
    <br>It was a busy week of work, and my body is very sore about it.
    <br>Still, I have so much to do to finish off the semester.
    <br>I have so much left that I want to do for the final project. I want to have it done by the time open house starts.
    <br>I also need to figure out what to present for my painting class because almost everything I made for Painting Now is in UAS.
    <br>Well, I'll try my best lol

    Since class time was all studio time, not many people didn't come to class.
    <br>I did consider working from home or in my studio space to get more time to work on projects outside of this class.
    <br>However, that would mean that I have to get my laptop out.
    <br>I really hate carrying it when I commute because it's so loud and heavy. Looking at the screen makes me very tired too.
    <br>But overall, this has been a very productive week, but my list of obligations isn't getting shorter lol
