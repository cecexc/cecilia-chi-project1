    <h1>weekly e 3/5</h1>
    <p>
        The past week I worked on the website, and I'm currently looking through
        the pages to get my thoughts back.
        <br>
        It's been a while since I looked at my site and the code behind it.
        <br>
        Starting with the home page/index file, I was frustrated with jquery and getting the mouse enter and leave actions right.
        <br>
        Positioning the buttons and drawings was also stressful, but z-index helped me with layering my assets.
        <br>
        I'm very happy how it looks, and I did everything I wanted to do.
        <br>
        When I have some time to go back, I would add motion to the other drawings besides the default image of me standing.
    </p>
    <p>
        On the weekly page, I'm so happy with the styling, especially with the star cluster gifs bordering the sides.
        <br>
        I really like the look of old Internet, and I think I did a pretty good job at recreating it.
        <br>
        I wanted the star clusters to move down the site, but I'm so confused on how to get animations to work.
        <br>
        I also checked the <a href="http://www.themostamazingwebsiteontheinternet.com/">site that I used as a reference</a>
        and saw they used the marquee tag.
        <br>
        However, I avoided it seeing that it's not supported. I think I'll keep it as is.
    </p>
    <p>
        The About Me page, I had so much fun looking for mini banners that I identify with.
        <br>
        When the site with the banners update, I'll go check to see if there's more I want to add.
        <br>
        I also had fun being very straightforward about my identity and politics through the banners and captions.
        <br>
        I might change my bio to match the super unapologetic, unserious energy of the banners.
        <br>
        Changing the font to Futura was confusing, and I have so many unused Futura weight files in my ccs files.
        <br>
        I really need to clean them out.
    </p>
    <p>
        Even though I'm satisfied with the current Writings page, I didn't do everything I wanted to do.
        <br>
        I didn't have enough time. I wished I had enough pages made to get a cool scrolling effect
        and button to go to a random page.
    </p>
    <p>
        I wanted to do something more complicated for the gallery, but did something simple.
        <br>
        The tutorials I found use Java, and I didn't have the mental capacity to learn Java by my own.
        <br>
        Still, I'm happy that I was still able to add a hover effect and captions.
        <br>
        I'm going to fix the flex box soon. It looked weird during crit.
    </p>
    <p>
        Overall, I collected my old internet interests, and I'm satisfied on how they look together.
        <br>
        It was fun making all the assets in Photoshop and Fresco.
        <br>
    </p>
    <p>
        Also, on this week, we started learning Java.
        <br>
        We learned on how to make points, lines, and shapes.
        <br>
        It's a little confusing because I have to do some math.
        <br>
        And I became an art major, so I could avoid math.
        <br>
        But, I should be ok if the math is simple lol.
