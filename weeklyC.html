    <h1>weekly c 2/4</h1>
    <p>
        The past week we worked on the exercises- hypertext and 5 variations.
        <br> It was fun to experiment, and I did almost everything I wanted to achieve.
        <br> For hypertext, I had fun thinking about how the viewer can interact with the links.
        <br> If I had more time, I would've added images and gifs that were my own.
        <br> Also, if I did the exercise differently, I would have write a plan tree of choices the viewer could make.
        <br> I didn't write any plan out, so I got lost with how the pages path out if I went something more open-world.
        <br> To compromise, I ended up with a linear path.

        I enjoyed styling on the Five Variations and finally learned how to make interesting backgrounds instead of a flat color.
        <br> Backgrounds were frustrating at first because the images and radial gradient wouldn't fill the whole page.
        <br> It was a quick fix using repeat or background-attachment.
        <br> The pre tag was helpful with text formatting.
        <br> Also, I finally learned how to change fonts from this basic Times New Roman to something more dynamic
    </p>
    <p class="font">like this impact font.</p>
    <p>
        With styling, I made my poem about being quiet so loud.

        Project 1 was introduced and it's basically make a portfolio site.
        <br> I already made an artist website for my professional practices class a year ago.
        <br> Looking at the websites that I picked for references, I think I'll be experimenting with text.
        <br> Going crazy with styling maybe to a point of being unreadable and not worrying about looking professional.
        <br> I have made a lot of writing that I have trouble sharing to my art website, so maybe this project will be its home.

        Other interesting things:
        <br> We also learned how to do flex in css. The link should be <a href="./flex.html">here</a>.
        <br> The discussion about online identity made me think about how I present myself on the internet vs. irl.
        <br> Also, how the experience is different for other people like black women.
        <br> Reading the article, I can relate to some points as I am also a woman of color.
